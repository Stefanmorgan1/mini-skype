DATE DUE: Week of April , 2016  INSTRUCTION:  In groups of four (4) or five (5) 
students are required to develop the application stated below. Students are required to 
build a Java based instant messaging (IM) system with some additional features 
(similar to skype). The application should use the MVC and the client server architecture.
Users will be given access to the system through a client application, each client

system.

next user without it being seen by any other party.

4. Group Chat - The application should allow a user to create a group chat and invite other
users to join, all messages sent in the chat should be visible to all users in the chat.

with a next user on the application or group.

6. Voice Over IP - The application should allow a user to start a call (not video call) 
session with a next user of the application.
